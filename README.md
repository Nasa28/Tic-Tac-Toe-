# Tic Tac Toe - Ruby OOP


## Game Rules
- Each player is going to choose a number out of 9 positions.
- Fisrt player should enter his name and press enter.
- Second player should enter his name and press enter.
- Fisrt player should enter his symbol [X or O] and press enter.
- To choose a position you have to type the corresponding number and press enter.
- The game will check if the chosen number is valid or not valid.
- If it's not valid (i.e already taken number or not of the game positions - from 1 to 9 ) it will ask for another input.
- If it's valid it will display the board with the chosen position replaced by the symbol of the player [X, O].
